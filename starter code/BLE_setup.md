# BLE setup on ardunio

This is the setup for a simple bluetooth perhipheral

The provided sketch turns on one LED when a any value other than 0 is written to the arduio

## Getting Started

These instructions will give you the tools necessary to comunicate with an arduino nano 33 ble.
There will be additional instructions at the end for how to use this projects GUI

### Prerequisites

- arduino IDE, the Beta version is suggested for linux


### setup

- download the "starter_BLE_LED.ino" 
- make sure the right device is chosen on the arduino IDE, seen in bottom right corner
- upload the sketch (sketches with bluetooth might take a while)
- power the arduino
- follow bluetoothctl README to interact with the arduino
