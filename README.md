This project combines the nano ble 33, python, and bash to create a blueetooth LED display and GUI

Take a look at the starter code for how-to instructions

## Getting Started

This instructional will help guide you in testing this project at home

### Prerequisites

- circuit setup prerequisites
- bash command line
- python3


### setup steps

- follow circuit setup
- download the repository
- upload the sketch "BLEArduino.ino" (found in arduino sketches) to the arduino
- make the bash scripts found in the GUI folder excecutable

For each file with ending in ".sh"

```
$sudo chmod +x FILENAME
```

## Deployment

- power up the arduino
- navigate to the GUI in the command line
- run the python gui

```
